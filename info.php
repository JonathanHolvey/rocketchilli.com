		<ul>
			<li>A website designed by Rocket Chilli will be eye-catching and memorable.</li>
			<li>Every site is designed from scratch to be unique, personal, easy to use and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
			<li>In addition I can provide logo design and brand development, along with things like business cards to match your website.</li>
			<li>My aim is to make you stand out from the crowd.</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="subTitle" id="useful">The useful stuff</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Everything is done for you so that you don't have to worry. I'll even find you a domain name to suit your venture, and set up your site to appear in search engines.</li>
			<li>I can integrate useful features into your website, such as blogs, shopping carts and web payment soloutions.</li>
			<li>Maintenance and updates to your website can be carried out at any time, either occasionally or on a regular basis.</li>
			<li>If you already have a website but it needs refreshing to improve the look or feel, or you want to add features I can help you upgrade.</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="subTitle" id="technical">The technical stuff</div>
		<ul>
			<li>I build websites according to standards set out by the World Wide Web Consortium, meaning that they work equally well in all modern web browsers.</li>
			<li>Standards compliant websites are the way forward. They are easier to update, and will continue to work in the future as new versions of browsers are released.</li>
			<li>The pages are coded in valid XHTML, making use of server side (PHP) and client side (JavaScript/jQuery/AJAX) scripting technologies to produce truly dynamic and interactive websites.</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="subTitle" id="money">The bottom line</div>
		<ul>
			<li style="list-style:none">And how much will it cost?</li>
			<li>Prices start from as little as &pound;50 for a single page, and if you want more the sky is the limit!</li>
			<li>The pricing structure can be tailored to suit your needs.</li>
			<li>If you're interested in commissioning a site please send details of your project via the contact page, and I'll get back to you with a quote.</li>
